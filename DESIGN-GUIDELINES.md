## 1. Brand Philosophy

Extensa is **technical and engineering-led**.

The brand prioritises:

- Clarity over decoration
- Systems over slogans
- Calm over cleverness
- Longevity over trends

Design should feel:

- Quiet
- Deliberate
- Precise
- Timeless

If a design element does not improve clarity, it should be removed.

---

## 2. Tone of Voice

### Always

- Clear, plain language
- Short paragraphs
- Observations from real work
- Declarative statements
- White space

### Never

- Buzzwords or hype language
- Marketing-style hooks
- Emojis (use rarely, if ever)
- Trend-driven phrasing
- Over-explaining

Preferred writing style:

> Clear thinking, clearly expressed.

## 3. Typography

### Primary Typeface

**Inter**

Use Inter for:

- Body text
- Headings
- UI elements
- Captions
- Social graphics

Approved font weights:

- 400 (Regular)
- 500 (Medium)
- 600 (SemiBold)

Rules:

- Avoid italics
- Avoid decorative fonts
- Do not introduce additional typefaces

Typography should disappear and allow the content to lead.

---

## 4. Colour System

Only the following colours are permitted.

### Primary

- **Charcoal:** `#111827`  
  Used for all primary text, headings, logos, and icons.

### Backgrounds

- **Off-White:** `#FAFAFA`  
  Default background colour.
- **Light Grey:** `#F1F5F9`  
  Used for section breaks, cards, and callouts.

### Secondary Text

- **Mid Grey:** `#6B7280`  
  Used for metadata, captions, and labels.

### Accent (Use Sparingly)

- **Muted Blue:** `#2563EB`

Accent usage rules:

- Use only for links, dividers, highlights, or emphasis
- Never use for large backgrounds
- Never combine with other accent colours
- Keep accent usage under ~10% of a layout

### Disallowed

- Pure black (`#000000`)
- Pure white (`#FFFFFF`)
- Gradients
- Additional accent colours
- Experimental palettes

---

## 5. Layout & Spacing

Design should feel structured and intentional.

### Layout Rules

- Left-aligned content by default
- Strong vertical rhythm
- Clear separation between ideas
- Fewer elements, more space

### Hierarchy

- Use size and weight, not colour, to indicate importance
- Headings should do the work
- Never rely on colour alone for meaning

If a layout feels empty, it is usually correct.

---

## 6. Social & Content Design

### LinkedIn

- Text-first posts
- Calm, observational openings
- No aggressive calls to action
- Carousels should be minimal and diagram-driven

### Instagram

- Consistency over variation
- Documentation-style visuals
- Calm, repetitive grid
- No trend-based styling

Content should feel like:

> Internal engineering notes, published publicly.

---

## 7. Imagery & Graphics

Preferred:

- Diagrams
- Simple line illustrations
- Screenshots of real systems
- Minimal charts

Avoid:

- Stock photography
- Futuristic AI imagery
- Decorative illustrations
- Visual noise

---

## 8. Logo Usage (Interim)

Until updated:

- Use logo in Charcoal or Off-White only
- No effects, shadows, or gradients
- Maintain generous clear space
- Do not stretch or distort

(Logo revision pending.)

---

## 9. Clothing & Physical Materials

Rules:

- Single-colour garments
- Small left-chest logo
- No slogans or taglines
- No back prints
- High-quality blanks only

If it looks like merchandise, it is incorrect.
If it looks understated and intentional, it is correct.

---

## 10. Final Check

Before publishing anything, ask:

- Is this calm?
- Is this clear?
- Is this reduced to the minimum?
- Will this still feel right in 5 years?
- Am I explaining, not selling?

If the answer is not “yes” to all five, revise.
